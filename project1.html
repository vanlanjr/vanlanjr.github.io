							<h2>The Problem</h2>
							<p>Throughout college, I've been using the Notes app on my iPhone to keep track of all of my assignments in
							my classes. This has been a very manual process. Every time I get a new assignment, I need to put it in the
							proper section for the given section. Once I complete an assignment, I delete it from the note. For some
							assignments, I decide a priority by putting a certain number of exclamation points next to it if it needs to be
							completed soon. I would like to create an app that would make this whole process easier and more efficient.</p>

							<h2>The Idea</h2>
							<p>My idea is to write an application using Vue.js that allows the user to create a Note for tracking a 
							List of Tasks that needs to be completed. The applcation will allow for the user to create multiple notes,
							just like the iPhone version.</p>

							<h2>Draft of First Requirements</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>The application allows the user to create a note or multiple notes</li>
								<li>The user is allowed to create a checklist of tasks on a note</li>
								<li>The tasks have a name, description, due date, and priority</li>
								<li>The application reminds the user when a task will be due soon</li>
								<li>The user can view previously completed tasks on the notes</li>
								<li>more coming soon...</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>After More Consideration...</h2>
							<p>After more consideration, I realized that the one functionality that I really want, in order to get the most
								value out of the app I create, is for the application to send push notifications to my mobile device when
								it is installed as a native application. The reason I want this is because that is a key feature that is missing
								from the plain jane Notes app on my iPhone and Macbook.
							</p>
							<p>Based on my research so far, I have compiled a couple of ways to get push notifications to send to a mobile device:
								<ul>
									<li>Using Vue.js as frontend, Django as backend, and Google Firebase Cloud Messaging APNs Interface as a gateway between 
											the two technologies.  In this solution,  Firebase allows for the application to send push notifications to the mobile device.
											Currently, I am still a little confused on how this solution will pan out but I am very passionate about it.  
											<a href="https://juliensalinas.com/en/vuejs-django-firebase-pwa-push-notifications/" target="_blank">Here</a> is the
											documentation I found for the overall solution and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client" target="_blank">
											here</a> is some information I found on setting up a Firebase client on iOS.
										</li>
									<li>Using Vue Native instead of Vue.js would allow me to have access to provided device APIs. The native version of 
										Vue has an API specifically for push notifications.  This would be a really simple way to solve my problem. However,
										by using Vue Native, I wouldn't be able to access my application on other devices, as it would be native to Apple, and 
										I wouldn't be able to access it from the browser. <a href="https://vue-native.io/docs/device-apis.html" target="_blank"> 
										Here</a> is the documentation I found on this subject.</li>
